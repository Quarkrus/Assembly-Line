Requiring only 8 J/t or 160W at 120 V to run, they offer a valuable alternative to moving items manually. Furthermore, only one belt in a segment needs to have a cable attached, as it will distribute power to the other belts. Power is fed in from the bottom of the conveyor.",

To load items onto a belt, you can either drop the item and the belt will pick it up, or the belt can extract items from an inventory. If a belt does not end in an inventory, then it will drop its items onto the ground. Conveyor Belts have 4 modes they can switch between by Right-Clicking a wrench on them. These are:",

The belt has an input at the front, with the other 3 sides being outputs. The GUI of the belt has 2 sets of 9 slots. Any item placed in a left slot will be output to the left of the input. Any item placed in a right slot will be output to the right of the of the input. Any other items not specified will be output to the back of the Sorter Belt. The Sorter also needs power to function, and has the same usage as a standard Conveyor Belt. This power can either be supplied to the bottom or from an adjacent belt with power.",
